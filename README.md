## Description
_In this application, you experience how powerful the term API is and you also get to explore one of the best sites to get amazing gifs which is: (giphy.com). I know you would definitely want to know what APi key I used, below which is the setup/Installation is where you can get all those. You get 3 amazing giphy features in this application, enjoy the APP_

## Setup/Installation
* First clone the project on your System(git clone _REPOSITORY-NAME_)
* Run npm install in the Terminal(e.g the git bash Terminal). with this, all of the dependencies of the application gets installed
* Then before running an "npm run start" which will build and start the application on a dev server here are a few things you will be needing for the application and those few things are:
* 1. An Environmental variable file: just create a file named .env(note: this is the place where you will be storing sensitive information like API keys and the likes)
* 2. Go to the website(giphy.com) or just type in giphy
* 3. Create a developer account which will make you able to generate API keys you will be needing for this application
* 4. Generate an API key with a name of your choice, now copy that api key(hint: an API key characters ranges from 20-25 characters) and then go to the .env file you created and in it create a variable(hint: variables created in a .env file are all capitalized and have an underscore_ separating each word) you can name your variable anything and then store your api key to be equal to that variable you created
* 5. Having done that, inside the index.js javascript file check to see a variable where I stored my openweathermap link in(endpoint) and in the "process.env.API_KEY" change it to a "process.env.API_KEY.THE_VARIABLE_NAME_YOU_STORED_YOUR_API_KEY_IN"
* 6. Ensure you take part in the no5 otherwise you'll get a "401: invalid api key" error. If you do get lost on the way, you can contact me below with the contact details I supplied below

## Detected Bugs/ Issues
* _No detected bugs_
* _The one bug you will definitely encounter is if you fail to follow any of the Setup/Installation Information I gave you_
* _Note: THis is the version 1.1.0 you were promised, and in this version you get to see me separating out my two logics(business logic and userInterface logic)
into two files, also in this app you will be learning about new JavaScript technologies like Promise, Async nd Await, and fetch. As at the launch of this Application there are no bugs but this is not the finished product as I will be adding more features later on. If anyone comes in contact with a bug, be sure to hit me up on social media or email me @emzzyoluwole@gmail.com. WATCH OUT FOR VERSION 1.2.0 WHICH IS COMING SOON. And also in version 1.2.0, I would be the application many steps further to include other great tools just to make the application a great one for the users _
